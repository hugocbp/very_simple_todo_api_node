# Very Simple Todo API with Node

This is a extremely simple API for a Todo app built with Node. The goal is to
have a toy app to learn the basics of API develpment with Node that can also
work as a quick cheatsheet for Node APIs.

## Instructions

1. Download
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Make requests to `localhost:5000`

## Testing

Testing templates are provided for both Paw and Postman in the `test/` folder.
Import the `*.paw` into Paw or the `*.json` file into Postman to test the
endpoints implemented so far.
